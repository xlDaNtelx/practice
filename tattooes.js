    tattooinfo:
      'Historically there was no writing in Polynesian culture so the Polynesian’s used tattoo art that was full of distinctive signs to express their identity and personality. Tattoos would indicate status in a hierarchical society as well as sexual maturity, genealogy and ones rank within the society. Nearly everyone in ancient Polynesian society was tattooed.The Polynesian islands that were first first visited were the Marquesas Islands, which were found by European explorers and the Spanish navigator, Alvaro de Mendana de Neira, in 1595. However, the European navigators showed little interest due to the lack of valuable resources.  Captain James Cook (as mentioned in our comprehensive guide to Maori tattooing) was the first navigator trying to explore the aforementioned Polynesian triangle.In 1771, when James Cook first returned to Tahiti and New Zealand from his first voyage, the word “tattoo” appeared in Europe. He narrated the behaviours of the Polynesian people in his voyage, which he called tattaw. He also brought a Tahitian named Ma’i to Europe and since then tattoo started to become rapidly famous, predominently because of the tattoos of Ma’i. Another legend is that European sailors liked the Polynesian tattoos so much that they spread extremely fast in Europe because the sailors emblazoned the tattoos on their own bodies. The actual tradition of Polynesian tattooing existed more than 2000 years ago, however in the 18th century the Old Testament strictly banned the operation. Since it’s renaissance in the 1980s, many lost arts were revived but it became very difficult to sterilise the wooden and bone tools that were used for the tattooing process so the Ministry of Health banned tattooing in French Polynesia in 1986. The revival of the art and practice of tattooing, particularly in Tonga, in recent years is predominantly referred to as a result of the work of scholars, researchers, visual artists and tattoo artists.'

    tattooinfo:
      "Irezumi (入れ墨, lit. 'inserting ink') are traditional Japanese tattoos. Irezumi is the Japanese word for tattoo, and Japanese tattooing has had its own distinct style created over centuries. Irezumi is done by hand, using wooden handles and metal needles attached via silk thread. This method also requires special ink called Nara ink (zumi). It is a painful and time consuming process, done by a limited number of specialists. The tattoo artist is called a Horishi, and usually has one or more apprentices working for him for a long period of time. They were admired figures of bravery and roguish sex-appeal, which inspired imitation. At the beginning of the Meiji period the Japanese government outlawed tattoos, and Irezumi took on connotations of criminality. Many yakuza and other criminals now avoid tattoos for this very reason."

      'Bold black lines that etch out the image of a wing spreading eagle, a rose encrusted anchor, or ship at sea...these are only some images that may come to mind when Traditional tattooing comes to mind. Part art movement, part social phenomena, the United States has created a style of ink that is all its own. Truly an important facet of American culture, we expound upon the history, designs and artists of this famed tattoo aesthetic. Traditional tattooing, as the case with all other styles of tattooing, has a foundation in the history of many cultures, and many countries. But, perhaps, there are a few reasons why Traditional Americana flourished so much. It’s true that sailors and soldiers were some of the main aficionados; their consistent travel to new lands guaranteed cross cultural experience with new styles and ideas. America has been involved in major wars, most notably since the American Revolution in 1775. Martin Hildebrandt, said to have opened the first New York City tattoo parlour in 1846, also stated that he had tattooed soldiers of both sides in the American Civil War. Part of the tradition of service men getting tattoos was not only to carry symbols of protection and reminders of their loved one, but to also mark their body for identification if their lives were lost in war.'

Perhaps the most lush and extravagant aesthetic in the tattoo community, this particular style blends the techniques of Traditional American tattooing with a rich history of arts and crafts. In this guide, we examine the history, influences, and artists who call the Neo Traditional method part of their own.'

      'New school tattooing incorporates elements from many tattooing traditions including irezumi, old school, and folk art. It is similar to old school tattooing in that they both generally employ heavy outlines. In contrast to the restricted palette in old school, however, new school tattoos frequently use a range of bright colors. New school tattoos are not realistic in that they exaggerate details in the subject; they are sometimes compared to styles seen in cartooning,[8] graffiti art,and themes seen in hip hop culture such as jagged edges and bubble letters.In terms of subject matter, new school tattoos are not restricted to traditional subjects (such as hearts and eagles). They feature fantastical subjects, novel patterns, and generally allow for a great deal of customization. However, old school subjects are commonly done in a new school style as a way of expressing homage or irony.'

Tattooist can even mix different styles together such as realism and geometric tattoo to give a more profound effect on a mandala tattoo or a stone effect to a Celtic or Irish tattoo design. Portrait Tattoos and photorealism ink have been on the rise in the past years. To enter into a career as a photorealism tattooist, one should first be an eminent portraitist. Realistic Tattoos are all about catching where the light comes from and how it does affect the effect on the paper and the skin.'

      "A geometric tattoo deals with several lines or geometric shapes that come together to form an even bigger shape. Geometric tattoos can come in the form of leaves, lines, stars, and a host of other patterns. Most often, tattoo artists use black ink to create these types of tattoos. A geometric tattoo usually has one design, usually a shape, that is repeated throughout the tattoo to create a specific design. It's a continuous pattern that is precise and detailed. Geometric shapes are usually shapes that have any number of sides and can be described by mathematics."

      "Dotwork is a tattooing technique where the artist tattoos several dots for a striking visual effect. These dots create either the entire image or just the shading. Dotwork used for shading is known as stippling. This technique uses black ink, grey ink, or sometimes red ink. A single dot may signify 'an end'. This one dot tattoo will become a symbol of your transition. Sometimes, it also represents how small your problems are, as compared to the massive human body you are packed in. On the other hand, three dot tattoos are also pretty common."

This effect is intended to mimic the characteristics of a classic watercolor painting, which is where the style gets its name. Whilst traditional tattoos are generally made up of many areas of solid colors that are all merged together to form one larger image; watercolor tattoos are created with much more gradual coloring.'

Sketch style tattoos are not as popular as say, watercolor designs but they’re quickly gaining traction in an industry with only a few solid styles of design. While numerous artists create sketch style tattoos every now and again—perhaps at the request of a client—only one artist has truly embraced the style and ran with it. Meet Inez Janiak. An uber-talented Polish artist that’s constantly creating jaw-dropping, game-changing sketch style tattoos that you really have to see to believe."

Part machine, part man, this type of tattoo reveals the inner human biological body makeup. Mechanical tattoos are exactly what they sound like. They are meant to give the human body a cyborg or half-machine look with “visible” mechanical parts. The best thing about mechanical tattoos is that they work well pretty much on any part of the body, even in the nether regions if someone is brave and crazy enough. There are several kinds of mechanical tattoos for men. The most popular version is the one that shows a ripped-apart skin, revealing a full range of mechanical internal body parts, which includes cogs, wires, metal joints, and springs. This version is usually seen in black-and-gray, though some prefer to make it more “realistic” by also mixing in human body parts such as veins and muscles in colored form. Some even go for a 3D-like effect to make it even more impressive to look at.'

The style resembles fine art collages in that in combines realistic images with smears, smudges, and kinetic designs that generate a discordant, chaotic look to the piece. Trash Polka pieces are only done in red or black ink. According to Volko, this style is a combination of “realism and trash; the nature and the abstract; technology and humanity; past, present, and future; opposites that they are trying to urge into a creative dance to harmony and rhythm in tune with the body”. It’s certainly an apt description and clearly the artists behind the style have given it considerable thought. For that reason they have claimed it as an (as of yet) unofficial trademark.'
