        "With its dying breath, it looks like startup-turned-laughing-stock WeWork is investing in esports.Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that WeWork filed a trademark with the United Kingdom’s Intellectual Property Office for “Play By We.” The application describes “entertainment services in the nature of online video game playing and esports,” “esports contests” and “providing facilities for video gaming events.”WeWork carved out a name for itself renting shared office space and tech services and, in August, was valued as high as $47 billion. After the company’s shady business practices and managers’ incompetence were exposed by its SEC filing, WeWork’s valuation plummeted to $8 billion and the company delayed its initial public offering. Far be it from us to give investment advice to a company that managed to bungle its IPO despite a $7.5 billion SoftBank investment, but WeWork isn’t the only fraying brand doing this. The retailer GameStop, whose share price has plunged and is closing 200 stores, is doubling down on its esports investment this year, too. GameStop has looked into “home-grown e-leagues,” esports education programming and tournament sponsorships. GameStop also opened an 11,000-square-foot arena called the GameStop Performance Center in Frisco, Texas, for the esports team Complexity Gaming. In an interview with Kotaku earlier this year, the CFO of Complexity Gaming declined to share with Kotaku whether the company is profitable.When it comes to charming money out of investors, “esports” is the new note to play, it seems, replacing “blockchain” (which was the new “wearable”)—one of those things that’s mysterious and sexy because it so perfectly balances being hard to explain, full of big numbers and a little science-fiction. Esports is the future, say the businesspeople reliant on its future success. Yet according to a Kotaku investigation earlier this year, the esports industry seems like it’s headed for a fat market correction. More generously speaking, “esports” isn’t the magic bullet for a sinking company’s money matters. I am a huge esports devotee and regular participant in Super Smash Bros. and Overwatch tournaments both IRL and on Twitch. Despite my fandom, and millions of others’, it’s also extremely unlikely that the esports industry is performing on the level that big players say it is. Analysts like NewZoo often say the world of esports is worth $1 billion—a slick number, yet one that may very well be made up. Industry professionals speaking with Kotaku have said they have no idea how that number could possibly be real. Even if the numbers add up, it’s often difficult to tell whether esports should actually get the credit. For example, it’s tough for outside observers to differentiate between players buying in-game Overwatch cosmetics for the New York Excelsior or players buying a simple in-game loot box.One Fortnite esports insider told Kotaku that they “don’t share any financial details. . . so almost everything you see out there is guesswork,” and at Riot, one insider said that many reports referencing League of Legends’ financial data are “garbage.”There have been layoffs at esports organizations Infinite, the ESL and Echo Fox. Even successful golden-boy esports organizations like 100 Thieves—ones experts cite as having actual, viable business models—can’t afford Activision’s $25 million buy-in for the Call of Duty league. Entire leagues like Blizzard’s Heroes of the Storm league and H1Z1’s pro league have shuttered, with the latter owing hundreds of thousands after shuttering. Esports viewership data is unreliable and, sometimes, intentionally inflated. ",

        "PARIS -- Riot Games debuted what it calls holo projection technology during the opening ceremony of the League of Legends World Championship final in Paris at the AccorHotels Arena. Using a product called Holonet, a fabric mesh scrim with metallic filament woven into the fibers, and precise lighting in the arena, Riot Games was able to bring the League of Legends characters from the game to life with hologram effects. We decided to go with the Holonet tech this year for a few reasons, Adam Mackasek, associate manager for esports events at Riot Games, told ESPN about the opening ceremony. This year's arena is indoors and has controlled lighting conditions, something we've not had for the last few world finals. This widened the range of tools we could use to bring our IP to life. We wanted to pick a technology that really fit the aesthetic and feeling of the songs we're performing this year. We didn't want to just do AR [augmented reality] because we've done it in the past. Instead, the team wanted to surprise fans and push ourselves to do something they've never seen before. Valerie Broussard of Philadelphia kicked off the holographic concert by performing Awaken, a song released earlier in the year to signal the beginning of the League of Legends calendar year.This show is doing things that are unprecedented, Broussard told ESPN a few days before the grand final at a rehearsal of the ceremony. There are things that even the Super Bowl [halftime show] hasn't done. I think from a technological standpoint, people are going to be truly wowed. My hologram is going to be the first one, so it's super exciting. I think it's absolutely thrilling to see this kind of technology really utilized. Preparations for the opening ceremony began in January. In addition to Awaken, the tournament's anthem, Phoenix, was performed by Chrissy Costanza and Cailin Russo. The debut single from augmented reality hip-hop group True Damage, Giants, consisting of vocals from Rebecca Becky G Marie Gomez, Jeon Soyeon So-yeon, Umar Thutmose Ibrahim, Jared Duckwrth Lee and Keke Palmer was also performed. Next year's League of Legends World Championship, the 10th edition, will be hosted by China, with Riot Games soon getting to work on making it bigger and better than this year's performance. The 2018 world championship final between Fnatic and Invictus Gaming was seen by 99.6 million unique viewers. The 2019 final, pitting Europe's G2 Esports and China's FunPlus Phoenix, sold out in seconds when tickets were put on sale, with third-party websites offering tickets for upward of $3,000 to see the biggest video game competition of the year.",

      text:
        "Team Heretics became one of the most popular names in Call of Duty esports in the past year, building a solid reputation for itself with its Spanish roster. A big change was impending upon the scene, however, in the form of franchising.The Spanish organisation applied to acquire one of the 12 franchise slots in the Call of Duty League but wasn’t successful, despite getting rather close. The sad news was broken to fans on September 14th and we later saw that ReKTGlobal and c0ntact Gaming acquired the two European slots for the inaugural season.Esports Insider sat down with Arnau Vidal, Founder & Co-owner of Team Heretics to find out about decision, what the organisation has been doing since, and his thoughts on how the league is shaping up.Esports Insider: Can you tell us about Activision Blizzard’s decision to not include you in the league?Arnau Vidal: We were excited about the idea of getting a franchise team for for Call of Duty. We believe that it’s the right path for us. It’s the right path for esports. I think that Activision Blizzard is really good at selling commercial deals that drive revenue to the league so I think that it’s going to be a good product.Specifically for us, we were born as a small Call of Duty team in Spain, we have grown a lot since, but we come from Call of Duty and most of our fan base comes from that game too. Our content creators used to focus on Call of Duty too, so when we knew that a league was coming, we knew that we had to be there because we belong to Call of Duty.We’re not a huge organisation like most of the owners of CDL franchises – we haven’t had any crazy investments rounds or anything like that – but we knew that we had to go for it. We did whatever we could to be there.RELATED: Paul Hamilton explains how Atlanta FaZe came to be ESI: So you think franchising is a good model for esports? AV: I think it’s good to control the teams that are part of the league, especially in Call of Duty. The last year was a total mess, there were a lot of organisations that didn’t bring anything to the table. There were 16 teams in the CWL Pro League and there were six or eight organisations that were actually bringing value. With a franchised league though, it totally changes things with the requirement to create new brands. That’s not something that I personally agree with but, apart from that, I think franchising is a good idea.  ESI: We’ve seen Atlanta FaZe manage to utilise FaZe Clan’s brand, does that go against what you believed was possible at the application stage? AV: That was surprising, I’m not going to lie. I read your interview with them to know how they actually managed to do that because, personally, I didn’t know it was possible. I’m sure that a lot of organisations, if they knew, would have done something similar. I guess they have their reasons for it but on our side we didn’t know that it could be done.",

        "With the announcement of the NBA 2K League European Invitational, the third-year league continues a tradition of milestones and expansion. With solid backing from the NBA itself and buy-in from 21 teams (set to currently be 23 in 2020), the NBA 2K League sits upon a solid foundation. Some fledgling esports league only dream of these sorts of growth opportunities and stories. Here are a few select moments where the 2K League has made an impact.There were some incredible moments for women in esports in 2019, and Chiquita Chiquitae126 Evans was part of one of those moments -- she became the first woman in the NBA 2K League when she was drafted last March ahead of the league's second season. She was picked in the fourth round, 56th overall, by Warriors Gaming. NBA commissioner Adam Silver had voiced displeasure in the past with the lack of women in the 2K League, signaling things needed to be more inclusive. And this wasn't the first time Chiquita was around the 2K scene. She previously earned a spot in the NBA 2K League Showcase in July 2018, where she became the first woman to score points in a 2K event. The former college basketball player at Kentucky State University was one of two female players eligible to be drafted in the 2019 2K draft. After being selected, she said It changes everything. It means everything to me.' The NBA doesn't have any international teams, but that didn't stop the 2K League from looking for interest abroad.The league announced on Sept. 26 that Shanghai would get an expansion franchise for the 2020 season and become the first 2K League team that is not affiliated with an NBA franchise. Esports organization Gen.G will operate the team, which became the league's 23rd franchise. The move was the first hint at the 2K League's international aspirations. Timothy oLARRY Anselimo was one of the victims of a shooting at a Madden championship qualifier in Jacksonville, Florida, on Aug. 25, 2018. The NBA 2K League pro was shot in the chest, left hip and twice in his right hand; though he survived, the wounds to his hand meant he would probably never play 2K professionally again.",

        "ANAHEIM, California -- A two-day slog ended in an unprecedented victory Saturday at BlizzCon.Cheers erupted inside the Anaheim Convention Center Arena as the six American players leapt out of their seats and were swarmed by their staff and substitutes. After four years of early-bracket exits at the Overwatch World Cup, Team USA had done it. They were the champions.Team USA featured arguably the best North American players in their roles: three from the reigning Overwatch League champions, the San Francisco Shock. The four others were standouts, if not stars, on other OWL teams.The talent translated into dominant performances, with the U.S. dropping only one map en route to their title. That loss came to three-time defending champion South Korea in a 3-1 semifinal series victory. After that win, Team USA went on to a 3-0 sweep of Team China.After a sloppy performance against Team United Kingdom in November 2018, the Americans avenged themselves this weekend with an 18-1 record on maps and not a single series loss. Well, we actually thought we're gonna 3-0 everyone, Overwatch World Cup MVP Jay Sinatraa Won said in a press conference after the team's win. But we dropped a map to Korea.This BlizzCon was an important moment for Blizzard Entertainment, which had a year beset with controversy, and for Overwatch, which on Friday announced its second installment after interest in the game had slowed down. The fourth-annual Overwatch World Cup and Team USA were the marquee draws on the esports side of BlizzCon.Another disappointing exit or upset loss in the quarterfinals would have certainly dulled the electric atmosphere in the Anaheim Convention Center Arena on Saturday and dampened Blizzard's annual celebration. This year was like a different mentality: Third time's the charm, and everyone works super hard, Team USA and Houston Outlaws support Shane Rawkus Flaherty said. It feels so good actually finally do that. Like, I don't, I don't really have words to really explain how I feel right now. But it was something that I wanted to do no matter what. Season 3 Overwatch League is going to be like a whole new challenge for us, moth said, but we're going to keep working really hard. We will never get complacent.",

        "The Los Angeles Gladiators beefed up their roster and made Overwatch League history on Tuesday by acquiring Gia Huy MirroR Trinh from Uprising Academy in a move both sides announced via Twitter. If approved by the league, the deal would make MirroR the first Vietnamese pro player in the Overwatch League.Neither side announced what the Gladiators sent Uprising in exchange for MirroR.The 18-year-old joined Uprising Academy -- the feeder squad for the Boston Uprising, the competitive OWL outfit -- prior to the Contenders Trials for 2019 Season 2. He went 7-0 in the trials to help the team qualify for Contenders 2019 Season 2.We're thankful for MirroR's hard work throughout his time with the team, Uprising Academy general manager Andrew AndrewKendo Fiori said in a statement. He is very deserving of this opportunity, and we hope to see him succeed in the OWL with the Gladiators next season. Paintbrush began last season with Mayhem Academy, the second-tier affiliate of the Florida Mayhem. However, the parent club released him and the rest of its roster in May when the academy club was scrapped. Paintbrush then competed for Revival in Overwatch Contenders Season 2 during the summer. Meanwhile, the fallout from the Los Angeles Valiant's steep fall in the 2019 Overwatch League continued Tuesday, as the squad announced the release of main tank Russell FCTFCTN Campbell. The Valiant posted on their Twitter account, We want to thank (FCTFCTN) for his contributions in our season turnaround and wish him the best moving forward in his career. FCTFCTN tweeted in response to the announcement, Thank you for everything Valiant fam, it's been a pleasure. On to whatever comes next! The Valiant originally acquired FCTFCTN from Mayhem Academy -- the feeder program for the Florida Mayhem -- in May, part of a four-player trade in which the Valiant received three players in exchange for tank Pan Seung Fate Koo. The Valiant finished second in the regular season and fourth in the playoffs in the OWL's inaugural season, 2018. But last season, the team dropped to 13th in the regular season, the first side to miss out on the play-in round. The move is the latest in an offseason of roster turnover for the Valiant. The team cut ties with DPS player Brady Agilities Girardi, off-tank Indy SPACE Halpern, and flex support Park KariV Young-seo in October. Overwatch League Season 3 begins on Feb. 8. The Valiant play the final match of opening day, against the Dallas Fuel.",

        "Star top laner Heo Huni Seung-hoon is finalizing negotiations for a two-year contract extension with Dignitas worth approximately $2.3 million in guaranteed money, league sources told ESPN.The deal would make Huni among the highest-paid players in the League of Legends Championship Series based off annual salary average. His contract would put him near the same annual earnings as fellow South Korean top laner Jung Impact Eon-yeong of Team Liquid. In late 2017, Impact signed a three-year deal with Team Liquid that was valued at $3.4 million over the course of that deal, as reported by ESPN. Dignitas declined a request for comment on the deal. The potential extension for Huni comes after he and Dignitas, formerly known as Clutch Gaming, finished competing at the League of Legends World Championship in Berlin in October. Heading into the 2019-20 offseason, Huni and jungler Nam Lira Tae-yoo were both on expiring contracts. The team has not renewed Lira at this time. For two years in a row, Huni has been one of the most valuable free agents in North American League of Legends. In late 2018, Echo Fox, who were kicked out of the LCS in September, did not have the money to extend the top laner's contract or match what other teams could offer. The 21-year-old was then signed by Clutch Gaming, where he competed throughout the 2019 season and qualified for his third world championship tournament. Huni has had a storied career that spans from his home of South Korea to Europe and North America. Originally a training squad player for Samsung in South Korea, Huni was scouted and recruited by European team Fnatic, which he joined in 2015. Huni won two domestic titles with Fnatic and went to the worlds semifinals with the squad. He then moved to North America to compete on Immortals for a season, where nearly made it to worlds again but lost in the regional qualifier. In late 2016, Huni joined multi-time world champion franchise SK Telecom T1, where he went on to place second at the 2017 League of Legends World Championship.",

        "It's rare that the League of Legends World Championship has two teams that both represent the year in its entirety. League is a game fraught with meta shifts -- the most infamous ones historically released immediately before the world championship itself -- and concentrated metas develop in miniature on the worlds stage. For a recent example: Royal Never Give Up exemplified what League of Legends was last year, yet failed to adapt to the shifting worlds meta and were eliminated in the quarterfinals in 2018 by G2 Esports. This year is different. No two teams sum up what League of Legends has been in 2019 more than FunPlus Phoenix and G2 Esports. G2 are on the cusp of claiming an elusive sweep of every major League title in a single year, something that has yet to be achieved by any team in the game's history. They've made it to this point, with a Mid-Season Invitational title and two domestic championships to their name, thanks to their remarkable flexibility. Although FunPlus haven't had that same impact, they've stubbornly stuck to their specific style of play through two successful regular-season splits. FunPlus dropped only one series during the summer series, and won China's hotly contested League of Legends Pro League title. Both of these teams know how to make the most of the talent available on their respective rosters, and this knowledge has brought them to the game's most prestigious match, which takes place at 7 a.m. ET on Sunday at AccorHotels Arena in Paris. Here are a few factors to keep in mind while watching the series. G2 have historically struggled against teams that make the most out of global ultimates, with the most recent example coming from Griffin's combination of a support Shen with two Teleports during Group A of worlds. FunPlus ran triple-Teleport in all of their games against iG and nearly all of their games against Fnatic. Additionally, FunPlus love to play champions with global or semi-global ultimates like Tahm Kench, Ryze and Gangplank. Globals don't guarantee victory against G2, but they already work well with exactly how FunPlus wants to play and help spread G2 on the map before they can set up split-pushes with their preferred stronger laning matchups.",

We bring partners out to Hi-Rez Expo every year, people who attend every esport event on the planet, and they all say the same thing: “This is special.” The passion of our fans is just unbelievable, and getting to spend a weekend with them is as much of a reward to us as lifting Thor’s hammer is to the SMITE World Champions. Then we just kept growing. We added the Hi-Rez Expo in a side hall, a secondary attraction to the SMITE World Championship. And then as we added the Paladins World Championship, it just made sense to change the event’s name to be more inclusive of Hi-Rez Studios’ multiple games. It was Cognitive Prime, a North American squad with some really lovable players on it, against Titan, this upstart European amateur team that had played their way through last-chance qualifiers. Titan shouldn’t have even made it to Hi-Rez Expo; they were 5 seconds away from losing before one player popped off, killed the entire enemy team, and won the game. And Titan was down 2-0 in the World Championship finals, but once again they fought back with an unstoppable, unexpected pick: Ares support. It went to a deciding fifth game where Cog Prime finally banned the Ares and battled to raise Thor’s hammer as the first SMITE World Champions. It was really in that moment when I was convinced I had to work at Hi-Rez, I had to be a part of this.",

      text:
        "Legends of Runeterra, Riot Games’ new card game, is in its second test weekend and this time around it has a draft mode. The mode is called Expedition and it brings a few new ideas to the draft formula from other collectible card games.As with most draft modes, this mode will start with players building a new deck from random cards. Players choose cards by selecting one of a few different “picks.” Each pick has a random combination of cards selected based on deck archetypes. They may feature cards from different regions, or focus on cards that emphasize things like stunning your enemy’s units or drawing cards from your deck.",
      textTwo:
        "When selecting picks throughout the deck-building process you’ll have two different types of picks: Synergy and Wild. Synergy picks will be randomly generated based on your currently selected deck and the archetypes you already have. Wild picks are usually for archetypes you haven’t selected. They can help you add a little bit of flavor to your deck, or maybe give you something so good that you totally change directions. Once you finish the draft phase, it’s time to start playing. Each Expedition goes until you reach seven wins or two consecutive losses. If you reach six wins, your final game will be sudden death; you either win your seventh or lose, but the Expedition run ends either way.In between each Expedition match you’ll have a chance to add a few new cards to your deck and switch things around. After some matches, you’ll have the chance to add additional picks to your deck. Other rounds you’ll have a trade round. Trade rounds select random cards from your deck and random cards from a shopkeeper. You have to decide if you want to trade your cards for theirs, or if you want to keep what you’ve got. If you didn’t get the number of wins you wanted your first time through an Expedition don’t worry, each Expedition comes with two Trials. That means you can draft a deck twice, and go for seven wins twice with just one Expedition. Whichever Trial has the better record after you complete both will determine your rewards. Speaking of rewards, every Expedition guarantees a Champion card as a reward, no matter how badly you do. But the more wins you get the more chances you have for better rewards, including rarer card packs and more Shards. You can complete three Expeditions a week for rewards, after that you’ll be able to compete in Open Matches, but you won’t get rewards for them.This is the first time that Expedition mode has been available for public testing, so it’s possible that some of these features could change before the Legends of Runeterra actually releases.

        "Blizzard's latest Overwatch short story digs into the history of Dr. Angela Ziegler, better known to fans of the game as Mercy, who finds herself working in a rundown aid camp on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt after the super-team's collapse. Entitled Valkyrie, the tale makes a few references to Sojourn, the first new character revealed for Overwatch 2, and also features appearances by Soldier: 76 and Ana, who as usual are having a rough time of things as they pursue Gabriel Reaper Reyes and his followers.",
      textTwo:
        "At the end of the story is an image of Mercy dressed up in (relatively) conventional doctor duds, which players can now acquire in Mercy's Recall Challenge, a new in-game event that kicked off today. Winning three games in Quick Play, Competitive, or the Overwatch Arcade will earn you a new player icon. Six victories will net a pair of new sprays, and for nine you'll take home the Dr. Ziegler legendary skin. You can also score more Mercy sprays for watching Overwatch streamers on Twitch: One spray for watching two hours of streaming, two sprays for four hours, and three new sprays for six hours of viewing. Watching in this case is kind of a flexible concept—Jeff Kaplan isn't going to check in to make sure you're actually paying attention, or even in the room—but you will need to have your Twitch and Overwatch accounts linked, which you can take care of at twitch.tv.",

Also noted is a slight change in how the summoned wolf companions work. The animals are always present once the skill is unlocked, rather than using a skill to call them. Instead, the activated skill will focus the Druid's wolves on their target.",

        "Back in May the total number of GTA 5 copies sold was 110 million, while in May 2018 it was 95 million. That means GTA 5 is selling roughly five million copies every six months. Pretty good for a cops and robbers game that first released in 2013. It'll be interesting to see if Red Dead Redemption 2 – which released for PC just this week – can come anywhere close to that figure. GTA 5 had the benefit of releasing across two console generations, and while it's possible that RDR 2 will be repackaged for next-gen consoles, the promise of backwards compatibility might make double purchases a whole lot rarer. There's also the small fact that RDR 2 is not GTA. ",

Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized online and offline competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity.By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing toward a professional esports subculture.

        "Spotify has launched Soundtrack your Ride, a new feature that generates a road trip playlist for you based on your Spotify history and your answers to a few questions. First, the tool asks you to put in your start and endpoints, and then it calculates your route and the length of your trip using Google Maps. This isn’t the first collaboration between the mapping app and streaming service: Google Maps and Spotify integrated a year ago to make it easier to stream audio while navigating.",
      text2:
        "Then, Spotify gives you a quiz consisting of five questions. It asks you who you’re traveling with, what kind of a car you drive, and what your “drive vibe” is (whatever that means). Spotify also asks you two music-related questions, with limited options. First, it’ll ask you what your favorite genre for the road is (pop, rock, hip-hop / rap, country, indie, EDM, or a genre called “mood”).Spotify will then ask you to pick “your ultimate driving song” from a mere six choices: Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody,” Vanessa Carlton’s “A Thousand Miles,” Jason Derulo’s “Ridin’ Solo,” Rascal Flatts’ “Life is a Highway,” Sam Hunt’s “Body Like a Back Road,” or “Sucker” by the Jonas Brothers. (There is a distinct split here among songs with a road or driving theme and songs with no such mention or connection to car travel.) ",
      text3:
        "Spotify will generate a playlist with enough songs to fill the length of your trip, which is then saved to your library. Based on my answers — rock, “Bohemian Rhapsody,” and “high energy” as my drive vibe — Spotify gave me a mix of classic rock and the music I typically listen to. Since Spotify is always so surprisingly on point with its personalized playlists, I felt like the road trip recommendations were less appealing than what I normally get through Spotify’s “Made for You” options.Soundtrack your Ride also has some critical flaws — namely, that you can’t really use this feature at the point when you’d need it the most, like when you’re on the road and realize you don’t have a playlist. It does technically work on mobile; I could navigate to the URL on the browser on my phone, but the format wasn’t mobile-friendly, with some of the answer options getting cut off. There’s no way to access Soundtrack your Ride through either the desktop or mobile app, at least for now. ",

The big new addition is Google Assistant support, allowing you to use a device with the assistant or app to control an Xbox One. Google Assistant won’t run on the Xbox One itself, but you’ll be able to use it to launch games, apps, turn the console on and off, pause videos, and more. Microsoft first started testing this feature back in September.Alongside the Google Assistant support, Microsoft is also implementing its new gamertag support in the November update. This means you can now pick any gamertag and use numbers at the end like Discord or Battle.net use. While you could change your gamertag earlier this year, it’s now fully supported on console in friends, messages, LFG, and more.",
      text2:
        "The final big addition this month is Xbox text filters. Microsoft revealed these filters last month, and they’re designed to prevent toxicity on the Xbox Live platform. There will be four new levels of text-based filtration available: Friendly, Medium, Mature, and Unfiltered. The Friendly mode is the most child-friendly option, designed to filter out all potentially offensive messages. If you opt for Unfiltered, it will work just like Xbox Live messaging mostly works today. You can download the new console update immediately in the settings section of the Xbox One, or wait for it to be automatically applied in the coming days.",

        "Of all the methods phone manufacturers have employed to get rid of bezels and avoid display notches, the second screen has to go down as the most elaborate. Who needs a selfie camera when you have a display on the back of the phone that you can use as a viewfinder? The most prominent example so far has been Vivo’s Nex Dual Display Edition from 2018, though the company’s return to pop-up selfie cameras with the Nex 3 suggests it may not consider its experiment to have been a success. ZTE spin-off Nubia, however, is pushing forward with the idea. After last year’s Nubia X saw a low-key release in China, the company is now iterating on the dual-display concept with the Z20, the latest iteration in its flagship Z-series. And, unlike many technically ostentatious Chinese phones, this one is actually available in the West — including the US. On pure price-to-performance ratio, the Z20 would be pretty competitive even without the second display. The phone costs $549/€550/£499 and includes a Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a triple-camera setup with Sony’s ubiquitous 48-megapixel IMX586 sensor alongside telephoto and ultrawide lenses, a 4,000mAh battery, and a curved 6.4-inch 1080p OLED screen. So far, so 2019 Chinese flagship phone, except that it runs more or less barebones stock Android 9. ",
      text2:
        "The Nubia Z20’s rear panel has a glossy metallic finish that picks up fingerprints if you so much as point at it. But in a strange way, it’s to Nubia’s credit that this is the most obvious criticism, because the panel also conceals a full-on 5.1-inch 720p OLED display. In all but the most challenging of lighting conditions and viewing angles, the screen appears to be near-seamlessly integrated into the frame of the phone. Frankly, it’s really cool. I’ve never been one for always-on phone screens, but it’s a different matter altogether when it looks like betta fish are swimming on the surface of the device itself. In use, too, the second screen is actually pretty nice. You can use it for anything you’d be able to do on the main display, not just as a camera viewfinder. If ever you’ve wanted a small Android phone for one-handed use without compromising the times when you’d want a bigger screen, this could well be the phone for you. Unlike the Nex Dual Display’s 5.5-inch 16:9 rear panel, the Z20’s second screen has a narrower aspect ratio and feels more like a shrunken-down version of a modern phone. The Nex Dual Display had a confusing system where you’d have to switch between screens with opposing sleep/wake buttons. I never got used to it, but the Z20 does a better job. While there are still sleep/wake buttons on both sides of the phone, it uses motion gestures to detect which screen you want to look at, and I found it to work well. Each button also has an integrated fingerprint sensor, which means you’re able to unlock the phone the same way no matter which way you’re holding it.",
      text3:
        "That said, I’m still not convinced that the concept is a great idea for anyone but full-resolution selfie enthusiasts. Pop-up selfie cameras have been around for almost two years now, and there doesn’t seem to have been too many reports of phones with dead motors. Notches, meanwhile, continue to be a non-issue for the dozens of millions of people that buy new iPhones every year, not to mention the hole-punch designs that Samsung has adopted for its 2019 lineup. The Nubia Z20 is a cool-looking phone with good specs and a pretty competitive price, but I think you’d really need to buy into the dual-screen concept for it to be your best option. Most people in Europe would get better value out of something like the £399/€399 Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro, and even in the US I’d recommend spending the extra $50 on a $599 OnePlus 7T with its better (albeit sole) screen and software experience.If you want a phone that stands out, though, or would sometimes appreciate the smaller screen, the Z20 might not be a bad buy. I can’t fault the specs sheet, nor can I deny the sheer appeal of its shimmery OLED back panel.",

        "Among the 50-plus new games that Microsoft is bringing to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service over the next year are ten Final Fantasy games. The list encompasses every single-player mainline game released in the series since 1997’s Final Fantasy VII, including select spinoff games like Final Fantasy X-2, and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII. Microsoft included the games in a list of titles that will start appearing “this holiday,” and said that they’ll be added over the course of 2020. There have been a bunch of different remasters of these games over the years, and in most cases it seems like Xbox Games Pass subscribers are getting the most recent version of each title. There are the HD remasters of X and X-2, and you’re also getting the Zodiac Age version of Final Fantasy XII. Here’s the complete list of Final Fantasy games coming to the service: Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy XV.The big two games missing from this list are Final Fantasy’s two MMOs, Final Fantasy XI and XIV. However, speaking to members of the press at X019 earlier today, Microsoft’s gaming chief, Phil Spencer, said that the company plans to bring Final Fantasy 14 to the service at a later date. “I wanted you to know, rest assured that we will be bringing that game to Xbox,” said Spencer. “We have a great relationship with Yoshida-san and we’re working through what it means to bring [to Xbox] a cross-platform MMO that they’ve run for years.” Other new games coming to Xbox Game Pass over the next year include Darksiders III, Tekken 7, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and multiple Yakuza titles including Yakuza 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2. If you want to try out the service for yourself, then Microsoft is offering a three month subscription for a promotional price of $1. For a limited time, the company is offering one month of EA Access, three months of Discord Nitro, and six months of Spotify Premium for new and existing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. ",

And since the console debuted in North America in the fall of 1985, its design — the familiar boxy shape; that matte gray, black, and red — has been an inspiration to nerds everywhere. The latest entry into this venerable canon, which includes everything from (fly as hell) Jordans to shelving, is the 8BitDo N30: a 2.4GHz wireless mouse made by the mad scientists over at 8BitDo.

The mouse features a 3D touch panel between the buttons for scrolling, and the D-pad on the side is for navigating websites — page forward and backward the same way you move Mario in Super Mario Bros. What’s more: 8BitDo says that a single AA battery will give you 100-120 hours of use.

While most of Microsoft’s significant Windows 10 updates usually come with a host of new features, this one is much more like the service packs you’d find with previous versions of Windows.

        "Security robots are slowly becoming a more common sight in malls, offices, and public spaces. But while these bots are often presented as replacements for human security guards — friendly robots on patrol — they’re collecting far more data than humans could, suggesting they’re more like mobile surveillance machines than conventional guards. A new report from OneZero sheds some light on the scope of the data collection, featuring marketing material and contracts between Knightscope and various city councils. Both show that the main purpose of these robots is gathering data, including license plates, facial recognition scans, and the presence of nearby mobile devices. It’s the sort of constant low-level surveillance that only a machine can perform.  Exactly what each robot collects differs, as Knightscope leases its bots rather than selling them outright, tailoring each contract to customers’ needs. But it’s a fair bet that if you’ve seen one of these machines in person, it’s recorded your presence in one way or another. ",
      text2:
        "As an internal report by California’s Huntington Park Police Department (HPPD) published by MuckRock back in August noted, “Knightscope’s secret to the K5 robot is simply sensors — lots of them.” HPPD started leasing a Knightscope K5 robot to patrol parks and buildings this June, and the robot soon made headlines when a passerby pressed its emergency button to report a nearby fight, to no effect. According to NBC News, the bot ignored the woman and continued moving down its preprogrammed path “humming an intergalactic tune” and pausing to tell visitors to “please keep the park clean.” Stories like this suggest that, as a replacement for human security guards (people who can respond intelligently and spontaneously to emergency situations), Knightscope’s machines are lacking. But as surveillance devices, they have a lot of potential. The report from the HPPD notes that the robots can identify nearby smartphones over an unknown range, recording their MAC and IP addresses. In Knightscope marketing material published by OneZero, this is a central part of the company’s sales pitch, with one slide telling customers: “90%+ of Adults Have Smartphones And Use WiFi When Available.” Scanning phones is a subtle form of surveillance with a far-reaching impact. It’s not as invasive as identifying someone by name, but it can be a rich source of information, telling you a lot about someone’s daily routine, like how often they visit a certain area and how long they stay there. As Knightscope says, it can also be used as a proxy to keep out unwanted individuals: just create a whitelist of approved devices, and scan for unfamiliar ones.",

        "Apple Music is introducing a fun new way to take a look at your listening history from over the past year. Called Apple Music Replay, the new feature will bundle up everything you’ve played in 2019, allowing you to see things like how many albums your music selections came from, or which top songs you had on repeat. To use Apple Music Replay, head on over to replay.music.apple.com and click on “Get Your Replay Mix.” It will then generate a playlist with your most played songs from 2019, along with additional playlists for every year you’ve subscribed to Apple Music. So, you could indulge in recent nostalgia or dip back to revisit your favorite tracks from other years.",
      text2:
        "Along with the playlists, Apple Music Replay will show your top artists and albums of the year, in addition to other stats like how many artists you listened to in total. Then if you like, you can share your Apple Music Replay playlist just like any other playlist in your library. There are other apps and streaming platforms that offer similar listening overviews, like Music Year in Review and Spotify’s “Wrapped” program, but this is the first time Apple Music is offering one. While Spotify’s “Wrapped” is only available during a certain window of time, Apple Music Replay will be available all year long, with playlists and data insights updating every Sunday.",

        "Valve might be working on a new cloud gaming service for Steam, as potentially revealed by code buried in the company’s own website.Steam Database, which actively tracks changes to Steam and to Valve’s games, noticed new code on Valve’s website for partners that asks them to agree to the “Steam Cloud Gaming Addendum.” If you want to see this for yourself, you can see the code on Steam Database’s GitHub or on Valve’s website (just search “Steam Cloud Gaming Addendum”). With only a name, it’s hard to know exactly what the service might be — but we think we can take an educated guess. It seems very possible that a service literally called “Cloud Gaming” in Valve’s own code could hint toward an upcoming cloud gaming service similar to Google’s Stadia or Microsoft’s xCloud, and that’s the kind of thing that might require Valve to sign some new distribution agreements with developers.A new cloud gaming service by Steam would make some sense, as it could round out Steam’s current game streaming options. You can already stream games with Steam Remote Play, Steam Link, and Steam Link Anywhere, but those all require your own gaming PC to act as a server, plus a very robust internet connection if you want to play outside of your own home — perhaps a new service could let you stream your games wherever you want without that active PC connection.There’s always the chance that Steam Cloud Gaming could be a rebrand of what Steam already offers, but it seems unlikely that a rebrand of already-released services would require partners to sign new agreements with Valve.",

        "When you try to return an item at Best Buy or Sephora, before deciding whether to take back the item, those businesses have apparently been secretly looking at something called your consumer score — a hidden rating based on data you didn’t even give them that determines how they treat you, according to Kashmir Hill’s recent expose for The New York Times. Apparently, your consumer score determines how long you’re kept on the line when calling customer service. It turns out, a lot of apps and services you use are quietly passing on your data to companies tasked with judging you and coming up with a rating for what you’re like as a consumer. Surprisingly, some of these third-party companies are willing to show you what data they have on you. Hill found out how to request her data from five of these companies, and the article explains what happened when she did. Sift, a company that looks for fraud, gave her a 400-page file that included a Yelp order for chicken tikka masala, vegetable samosas, and garlic naan she made on her iPhone three years ago. The file contained every Yelp order she’d ever made and every Airbnb message she’d ever sent. Hill also points out what’s missing from the file: while companies do show you your data, they don’t tell you how they calculate your score or how they use your rating to make decisions about you.",

        "Five years ago today, Amazon surprised the tech press by unveiling Alexa and the Echo, its first smart speaker. “Well this one came out of nowhere,” was the reaction of Verge reporter Chris Welch. Five years later, Alexa is a household name — literally. If you have children and an Alexa device, they probably know how to ask the robot to play their favorite songs at breakfast. You might have Alexa in your kitchen, on your bedside table, or even in your car.  But half a decade after Alexa launched, there’s a lingering question: has Amazon’s assistant actually become more useful?",
      text2:
        "For me, the answer is a clear “no.” I started using an Echo speaker not long after it became available in the UK, and after messing around with some lackluster skills on Amazon’s haunted house of an app store, I quickly settled on a few key use cases: playing music and radio, setting timers, and occasionally asking about the weather and Wikipedia-level trivia. Years later, I still have an Echo, and I still use it for the exact same tasks. Nothing has changed. Don’t get me wrong, I think the Echo performs these functions pretty well. But like many users, I’ve learned that posing any trickier queries is asking for trouble.No one would disagree that Alexa has been a huge success for Amazon. The company has added its voice assistant to a cornucopia of gadgets, from smart rings to microwaves. It’s sold more than 100 million Echo devices, integrated Alexa with 85,000 smart home products, and its app store now boasts over 100,000 skills. On a cultural level, Alexa has even managed to give the cut-throat and merciless Amazon a bit of personality.The company has also poured huge resources into making Alexa more usable. It’s churned out new features like whisper mode, Alexa Guard, and Alexa routines while banging away at the underlying promise that Alexa is slowly getting better at conversations and chit-chat. This, says Amazon, will allow it to tackle more complex tasks (like ordering an Uber or notifying you about a delayed flight) more naturally and gracefully. But Amazon has been promising this sort of functionality for a long time, and it doesn’t seem to be a whole lot closer to its goal. ",
      text3:
        "There are a few factors at play. First is the difficulty of getting computers to understand language, a challenge I saw first-hand while covering Amazon’s $3.5 million Alexa Prize. Thanks to new machine learning techniques, we’ve gotten pretty good at turning the audio of speech into text from which we can extract basic commands. But any interaction more complex than that is still out of bounds. Language is just inherently nuanced and human. It’s our greatest civilization tool, and although we can use verbal tricks to give computers the appearance of comprehension, these shortcuts don’t hold up for long. Second is Alexa’s absence on mobile devices. It’s omnipresent in households, but I don’t know anyone who uses it instead of Siri or Google Assistant on their phone. This puts a limit on its ability to function as a daily helper. You live on your phone; any assistant needs to be there, too. The third problem is the most immediate: getting Alexa to work as advertised requires too much effort and trust from users. You might use Alexa to set up a morning routine in your smart home, but that will take time. It also means you have to trust Alexa, not only in terms of privacy (where Amazon has made repeated mistakes) but also trusting that the assistant will do what you’ve asked. I don’t use Alexa to shop on Amazon, for example, because I don’t trust that I’m getting all the information I need about what I’m buying. It’s just not reliable in a way that encourages repeat use.I’m happy to use Alexa for the same jobs I used it for years ago, but I’d also swap my Echo for a generic voice-controlled speaker that can perform those same functions. Perhaps that’s just me. Perhaps I’m just not comfortable doing more with Alexa. But I don’t think there’s anything unique about this technology or, after years of development, that it’s close to living up to its promises. If Amazon doesn’t improve its tech over the next five years, then Google, Apple, and plenty of others have shown they’re eager to step into Alexa’s shoes. ",
